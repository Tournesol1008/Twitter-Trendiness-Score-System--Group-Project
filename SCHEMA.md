We are thinking to create a schema that includes several columns and rows. Each row would represent a word that we are searching, while each word would corresponding to a number count. 
The schema will be consisted of several entities: tweets, tweets urls, users, times, ratios, and etc. 
For the tweets attribute, it has attributes: tweets_id, content, user_id, time, url.
